UNC COMP 664 - Deep Learning Homework Assignments

All assignments have instructions within the .ipynb files

Topics by Assignment:

HW 2: log-likelihood loss, logistic regression

HW 3: gradient descent from scratch, momentum optimizer, Adam optimizer, SGD

HW 4: backpropagation, MLP from scratch, sigmoid cross-entropy function, 

HW 5: receptive field, CNNs, training CNN to classify CIFAR-10 dataset (AlexNet)

HW 6: batch normalization to fix unstable gradients, comparing L2 norm of gradients with/without batch normalization, applying residual connections around different blocks (solves vanishing gradient problem)

HW 7: training and using Karpathy's char-RNN RNN LLM, looking at the difference in loss between GRU RNN and Vanilla RNN

HW 8: seq-to-seq model on English to French phrase translation, difference in adding layers to loss

HW 9: attention pooling to solve "addition problem" from LSTM paper to test RNN propogation over time steps, using feed-forward layers and attention pooling layers

HW 10: train sentiment classifier on SST-2 dataset using pre-trained BERT model and Hugging Face Transformers Library. First, fine-tuning DistilBert from scratch and bert-tiny from scratch. Second, inputting the BERT output into a linear classifier and training the classifier using sentence-transformers library

HW 11:
